stack is also called as pushdown list.
stack is also used to check nesting depth.

An Stack consists of int top and an array.
i.e    
    stack{
        int top;
        int arr[size];
    };

There are fundamentally two ADT for stack.
    1.  PUSH(stack,element)
    2.  POP(stack)

and other functions for stack for checking illegal actions (actions that causes stack underflow and stack overflow).
    a.  empty(&s)
    b.  isfull(&s)
    c.  popandtest(&s,&x,&und)  { und --> underflow }
    d.  pushandtest(&s,x,&overflow)
